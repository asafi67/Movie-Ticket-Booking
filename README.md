# Movie Ticket Booking

## Project Description

This project is a Discord application that simulates a ticket booking system for movie theaters using a MySQL database. The backend is written in Node.js and includes the following components:
- **Db.js**: Contains functions for executing different SQL stored procedures and functions detailed in database.sql.
- **models.js**: Implements the queries and uses ORM implementation.
- **index.js**: Contains commands for executing the database's stored procedures and functions.
- **inserts.sql** Contains INSERTS for populating the database with dummy data for testing. 

The application is still in progress, with plans to create a frontend. The project also includes **m3.pdf**, which contains conceptual documentation such as functional and non-functional requirements, and database EER and ERD diagrams.
