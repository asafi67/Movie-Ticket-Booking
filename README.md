# Movie Ticket Booking

## Project Description

This project is a Discord application that simulates a ticket booking system for movie theaters using a MySQL database. This backend is written in Node.js and includes the following components:
- **Db.js**: Contains functions for executing different SQL stored procedures and functions detailed in database.sql.
- **models.js**: Implements the queries and uses ORM implementation.
- **index.js**: Contains commands for executing the database's stored procedures and functions.
- **inserts.sql** Contains INSERTS for populating the database with dummy data for testing.
- **business_requirements.pdf** Lists the ideal business requirements that the application should fulfill using stored procedures and functions in the database.
- **database.sql** Contains CREATES for all tables in the database, as well as the stored functions, procedures and triggers. 

The application is still in progress, with plans to create a frontend. The project also includes **m3.pdf**, which contains conceptual documentation such as functional and non-functional requirements, and database EER and ERD diagrams. 

Note: This project was transfered over from Replit which is where it was initially developed, resulting in currently having few commits. But knowledge of git will result in a more extensive workflow and commit history as the project continues development.
